This package contains files for the remake of character model parts for Neverwinter Nights 1 as created by me(Stonehammer)
The files contained will replace the REGULAR and LARGE body basic model (_001) for the following parts: (Neck, Torso, Bicep, Forearm, Hands, Pelvis, Leg, Shin, Foot) 
Available for Original Content races (Half_Orc, Human, Dwarf, Elf, Gnome, Halfling)

Notes: 
- With the exception of the Hands, Feet and Female Pelvis and Torso, all other parts are completely new
- With the exception of the Hands and Feet. ALL parts model should be visually compatible to some degree with original content textures (PLTs). 
  It is however best to use the custom textures that came with this package
- Does not have 2DA files since these simply overwrite existing content

2 ways to use:
1. HAK FILE - Move the Hak file in your game's hak folder and add it to you game using the toolset
2. OVERIDE - Or Drop all the files in your overide folder

Another Body Rebuild? Why?
I know there are a lot of Neverwinter Nights body rebuild content, and some are very good. I, however want to have a balance between simple low polycount models and engaging anatomical aesthetic, that is also highly compatible to other custom content. 
I could not find something that satifies my requirements so I made my own.

A lot of original content are in dire need of an update (Like the original content (OC) Neck, which is just an ill proportioned brownish diamond thing with no features) so I fixed that.

It is also my hope that people would use this as a base for their custom content so it will be easier for everyone to mix and match custom content (like an armorparts Lego)

Features: (Ver1.1 - 11272018)

NEW: Now includes Large Pheno

New polished body parts that fit properly with one another. (All made from the basic cylinder shape)
Texture values are customized adjusted to be consistent with the whole figure (no more mismatching dark/light parts)
Texture details are customized to show the most visually acceptable and be as anatomically accurate possible
Things that should have some jiggle, will jiggle, but not excessively (its twerk friendly)

General Credits:
The Neverwinter Vault, for keeping the game's custom content community active
Original new parts based from original content by me (Stonehammer)
Slightly revised Hand and feet models from Gunner's Body rebuild (He still has the best hands and feet in the game in my opinion)

I play tested everything as best as I can, but if there is anything that looks odd or requires fixing with this release, 
please message me through the nwnvault or comment below in the upload page

If you downloaded a previous version just drop the newer version on the same location and overwrite
